# Financial Association Management App (جمعية مالية)

## Project Overview

A comprehensive Flutter-based mobile application designed to digitally manage and coordinate traditional financial associations (جمعيات) popular in Jordan and across the Arab world. The app serves as a modern solution for organizing group savings schemes where participants contribute monthly amounts and receive payouts in predetermined months through a fair draw system.

### Core Concept
Traditional financial associations involve a group of people who agree to contribute a fixed monthly amount. Each month, one member receives the total collected amount (minus their own contribution). The app digitizes this process, making it transparent, organized, and efficient while maintaining the traditional trust-based approach.
